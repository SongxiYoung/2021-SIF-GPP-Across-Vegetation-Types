ABSTRACT:

Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is an emerging remote sensing technique that gives information of vegetation photosynthesis.

This study:
1.Designed a chlorophyll fluorescence inversion algorithm based on a physical model, given the chlorophyll fluorescence driving factors inferred from the SCOPE model.

2.Evaluated the relationship between the chlorophyll fluorescence and gross primary productivity across different vegetation types:
The linear relationship of SynSIF-GPP outachieved other SIF datasets across all six vegetation types in southern South America, Asia, and Africa, improving R^2 averagely by 0.33, 0.28, and 0.15, respectively.  
SynSIF in Oceania and Europe, revealing GPP better in shrublands (with SynSIF-GPP R^2 increasing by 0.15 and 0.16, respectively) and grasslands (with SynSIF-GPP coefficients increasing by 0.14 and 0.06, respectively), illustrated spatially complementary characteristics with GOSIF across varying vegetation types. 

Thus, we anticipate that this study could provide more complete information for SCOPE simulating SIF in different biome research when estimating the terrestrial carbon cycle.
