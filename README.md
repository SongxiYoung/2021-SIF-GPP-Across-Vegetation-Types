ABSTRACT:

Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is an emerging remote sensing technique that gives information of vegetation photosynthesis.

This study:

1.Designed a chlorophyll fluorescence inversion algorithm based on a physical model, given the chlorophyll fluorescence driving factors inferred from the SCOPE model.

2.Evaluated the relationship between the chlorophyll fluorescence and gross primary productivity across different vegetation types.

Thus, we anticipate that this study could provide more complete information for SCOPE simulating SIF in different biome research when estimating the terrestrial carbon cycle.
